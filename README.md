# hello-world.
My very first repository
Hi everyone! I want to dive "head first" into the world of programming. I'm here to learn and collaborate. Currently working on a NFT project on Open Sea with a good friend of mine. He's the artist, so I guess that makes me the 'programmer'. Sorry if some of the questions I ask seem remedial, I'm new to all of this, but am eager to learn.
